# python-json-to-csv
Parsing JSON from JIRA API into a CSV file using python scripts. *Working*

Using JQL queries filter IR created date ranges with specific fields that I want to upload to a spreadsheet. *Working*

test.py is a code dump of all research, alternate methods, and trying new ideas. Doesnt need to compile. *purely for notes*

Uploaded the bash script that runs the scripts individually all at once. Also created a cron job to perform tasks weekly in the background. Working on making it upload to the Google Drive API automatically whenever a change occurs and expor the CSV files into Google Sheets. *Work in progress*
