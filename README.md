# python-json-to-csv
Parsing JSON from JIRA API into a CSV file using a Python script current work in progress. I still need to get the correct JQL search options correct for each date range. 

Using JQL queries filter IR created date ranges with specific fields that I want to upload to a spreadsheet.

test.py is a code dump of all research, alternate methods, and trying new ideas. Doesnt need to compile.
